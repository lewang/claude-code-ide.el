;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides an MCP tool for refreshing the Magit status buffer.
;; After Claude Code makes git changes (commits, stashes, etc.), the Magit
;; status buffer becomes stale.  This tool lets Claude trigger a refresh
;; to keep the user's git UI in sync.

;;; Code:

(require 'claude-code-ide-mcp-server)

(declare-function magit-get-mode-buffer "magit-mode" (mode &optional value frame))
(declare-function magit-refresh-buffer "magit-mode" ())

(defun claude-code-ide-mcp-magit-refresh ()
  "Refresh the Magit status buffer for the current session's project.
Uses session context to determine the project directory, then finds
and refreshes the corresponding magit-status buffer if one exists."
  (claude-code-ide-mcp-server-with-session-context nil
    (cond
     ((not (fboundp 'magit-get-mode-buffer))
      "Magit is not installed or not loaded")
     (t
      (let ((buf (magit-get-mode-buffer 'magit-status-mode)))
        (if (not buf)
            (format "No magit-status buffer open for %s" default-directory)
          (with-current-buffer buf
            (magit-refresh-buffer))
          (format "Refreshed magit-status buffer for %s" default-directory)))))))
